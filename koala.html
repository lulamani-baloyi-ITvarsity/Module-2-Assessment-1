                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>Koalas are small animals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests
                    that African bush koalas and African forest koalas are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). koalas are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving
                    family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African koalas are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4 m (13
                    ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).
                </p>
                <p>All koalas have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as
                    weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. koalas' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African koalas have larger ears and concave backs while Asian
                    koalas have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
                <p>koalas are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>You will find the koalas at pen E40, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
